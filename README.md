# MONAS
## Standalone
C++ toolkit that calculates cell survival and dose dependent RBE from micorodosimetric spectrum from TOPAS MC simulation

## Topas Extension
Topas extension which is called at the end of the TOPAS MC simulation. It takes the TOPAS simulated y-spectrum to calculate cell survival and RBE
